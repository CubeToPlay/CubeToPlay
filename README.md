### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my github profile, I am Adam.
I like to program on my free time, and here is where I have placed some of my projects.

Recently, I have been very into c++, but had started off with lua in Roblox. I had taken a class in python, and have some experience with html, css, java, and javascript. I am currently a seinor in high school and am planning to persue a degree somewhere in software.

Thank you for reading this, and I hope you enjoy your time here ðŸ‘‹
